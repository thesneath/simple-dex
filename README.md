Hello! 
Welcome to SimpleDex by Alex Sneath. 
You can see this project in action at https://thesneath.github.io/simple-dex/

Project Dependencies:
    * JavaScript
    * BootStrap

This is a Pokédex that interacts with the PokeApi API to gather the following information:
    * The first 151 Pokémon
    * Each Pokemon's:
        * Name
        * Types
        * Height (in decimeters)
        * Front Image

Each Pokémon is displayed as a clickable list item. 
When an item is clicked, a Bootstrap modal pops up and displays the above details.

Thanks for taking a look!
